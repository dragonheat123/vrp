//! This example demonstrates how to add a job priority feature which prioritized assignment of
//! some jobs over others. It is based on closed (no return to a depot) CVRP variant.
//!
//! Here, we assign a top priority to a few jobs, so that we expect them to be preferred for assignment.
//!
//! Key points here:
//! - how to define custom objective function with [FeatureObjective] and how to use it within the solver's framework
//! - how to use state management capabilities for custom fitness calculation optimization with [FeatureState]
//!
