# ROSOMAXA

`ROSOMAXA` stands for Routing Optimizations with Self-Organizing Maps And EXtrAs - a custom evolutionary algorithm which
tries to address the problem of population diversity: ability to retain different individuals in the population and use
them as an input for the search procedure. Additionally, it utilizes reinforcement learning technics to dynamically pick
suitable meta-heuristics for given problem formulation to avoid premature convergence.


## Key ideas

The `rosomaxa` algorithm is based on the following key ideas:

* use [Growing Self-Organizing Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growing_self-organizing_map)(GSOM) to cluster discovered solutions and retain good, but different ones
* choice clustering characteristics which are specific to solution geometry rather to objectives
* utilize reinforcement learning technics in dynamic hyper-heuristic to choose one of pre-defined meta-heuristics on each solution refinement step.
* use 2D visualization to analyze and understand algorithm behavior. See an interactive demo [here](https://reinterpretcat.github.io/heuristics/www/)


### Clustering

Solution clustering is preformed by custom implementation of GSOM which is a growing variant of a self-organizing map.
In `rosomaxa`, it has the following characteristics:

* each node maintains a small population which keeps track of a few solutions selected by elitism approach
* nodes are created and split based on selected solution characteristics. For VRP domain, they are such as:
     - vehicle max load variance
     - standard deviation of the number of customer per tour
     - mean of route durations
     - mean of route distances
     - mean of route waiting times
     - average distance between route medoids
     - amount of routes
* periodically, the network is compacted and rebalanced to keep search analyzing most prominent local optimum.
  Compaction is done using a "decimation" approach: remove every second-third (configurable) column/row and move
  survived cells towards the center (a node with (0, 0) as a coordinate). Overall, this approach seems help to maintain
  a good exploration-exploitation ratio.


### Visualization

This old animation shows some insights how algorithms performs over time:

![Visualization example](../../images/rosomaxa.gif "Visualization")

Here:
* `u_matrix` is unified distance matrix calculated using solution characteristics
* `t_matrix` and `l_matrix` shows how often nodes are updated
* `objective_0`, `objective_1`, `objective_2`: objective values such as amount of unassigned jobs, tours, and cost

The new experimental visualization tool is part of the repo: `experiments/heuristic-research`.
Online version is available here: https://reinterpretcat.github.io/heuristics/www/vector.html


### Dynamic hyper-heuristic

Essentially, a built-in dynamic hyper-heuristic uses [Multi-Armed Bandit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit)
with [Thompson sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_sampling) approach to pick meta-heuristic for the list.
This helps to address [exploration-exploitation dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration-exploitation_dilemma)
in applying a strategy of picking heuristics.

Implementation can be found [here](https://github.com/reinterpretcat/vrp/blob/master/rosomaxa/src/algorithms/rl/slot_machine.rs)


### Additional used techniques

TODO: describe additional explorative techniques:

- tabu list usage in ruin methods
- alternative objectives manipulation
- ..


## Further research

* experiment with different solution characteristics
* rebalance GSOM parameters based on search progression
* analyze "heat" map dynamically to adjust GSOM parameters
* more fine-grained control of `exploration` vs `exploitation` ratio
* try to calculate gradients based on GSOM nodes
