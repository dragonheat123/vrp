Here you can find multiple examples how to use different features such as break, reload, multi job, etc.

Each example consists of:

For selected examples:

* __geojson__ visualization with `leaflet`
* __ordered list of unique locations__: a json file with list of locations in specific order which can be used to
    request a routing matrix. More info can be found [here](../../concepts/pragmatic/routing/format.md)
* __routing matrix__: a json file with routing matrix described [here](../../concepts/pragmatic/routing/index.md)
* __CLI command__ command line which can be used to reproduce results locally using `vrp-cli` tool. Original data can be
