# Objective examples

Examples in this section demonstrate how different objectives affect final solution. All of them use the same problem
variant with different objectives.
 
Essentially, the problem definition has the following parameters:

* `50` deliveries with demand `1`
* `5` vehicles with capacity `20`
* fixed vehicle cost is `20`
* no time windows
